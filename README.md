# Glance Experimental Tools

This project aims to supplement Jetpack Glance with features that are commonly required by developers
but not yet available.

It is a labs like environment for Glance tooling. We use it to help fill known gaps in the framework,
experiment with new APIs and to gather insight into the development experience of developing a Glance library.

## Libraries

### üñºÔ∏è [Preview-appwidget](./preview-appwidget)

A tool to display AppWidget previews embedded inside the app for faster iterations. 

### üõ†Ô∏è Configuration-appwidget

üöß Work in-progress

## Future?

Any of the features available in this group of libraries may become obsolete in the future, at which point they will (probably) become deprecated.

We will aim to provide a migration path (where possible), to whatever supersedes the functionality.
